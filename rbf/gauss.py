''' 
This module defines a class, `GaussianProcess`, which is an 
abstraction that allows one to easily work with Gaussian processes. 
One main use for the `GaussianProcess` class is Gaussian process 
regression (GPR). GPR is also known as Kriging or Least Squares 
Collocation.  It is a technique for constructing a continuous function 
from discrete observations by incorporating a stochastic prior model 
for the underlying function.  GPR is performed with the `condition` 
method of a `GaussianProcess` instance. In addition to GPR, the 
`GaussianProcess` class can be used for basic arithmetic with Gaussian 
processes and for generating random samples of a Gaussian process.

There are several existing python packages for Gaussian processes (See
www.gaussianprocess.org for an updated list of packages). This module
was written because existing software lacked the ability to 1) create
partially improper Gaussian processes 2) compute analytical
derivatives of a Gaussian process and 3) condition a Gaussian process
with derivative constraints. Other software packages have a strong
focus on optimizing hyperparameters based on data likelihood. This
module does not include any optimization routines and hyperparameters
are always explicitly specified by the user. However, the
`GaussianProcess` class contains the `likelihood` method which can be
used with functions from `scipy.optimize` to construct a
hyperparameter optimization routine.


Gaussian Processes
==================
A proper Gaussian process, :math:`u_o(x)`, is a stochastic function
that is normally distributed in the space of all functions. A Gaussian
process can be defined in terms of its mean, :math:`\\bar{u}(x)`, and
its covariance, :math:`C_u(x,x')`, as

.. math::
  u_o \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\bar{u},C_u\\right).

In this module, we adopt a more general definition which allows for
partially improper Gaussian processes (i.e. a Gaussian process which
has infinite variance along some directions).  We then consider a
Gaussian process, :math:`u(x)`, to be the combination of a proper
Gaussian process and a set of basis functions, :math:`\mathbf{p}_u(x)
= \{p_i(x)\}_{i=1}^m`, whose coefficients, :math:`\{c_i\}_{i=1}^m`,
have infinite variance. We express :math:`u(x)` as

.. math::
  u(x) = u_o(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m c_i p_i(x).

Throughout this module, we refer to :math:`\mathbf{p}_u(x)` as the
improper basis functions. We consider five operations on Gaussian
processes: addition, subtraction, scaling, differentiation, and
conditioning. Each operation produces another Gaussian process which
possesses the same five operations. These operations are described
below.


Operations on Gaussian Processes
================================

Addition
--------
Two uncorrelated Gaussian processes, :math:`u` and :math:`v`, can be 
added as

.. math::
  u(x) + v(x) = z(x)

where the mean, covariance, and improper basis functions for 
:math:`z` are

.. math::
  \\bar{z}(x) = \\bar{u}(x) + \\bar{v}(x),

.. math::
  C_z(x,x') = C_u(x,x') + C_v(x,x'),
  
and 

.. math::
  \mathbf{p}_z(x) = \mathbf{p}_u(x) \cup \mathbf{p}_v(x).

Subtraction
-----------
A Gaussian process can be subtracted from another Gaussian processes 
as

.. math::
  u(x) - v(x) = z(x) 

where 

.. math::
  \\bar{z}(x) = \\bar{u}(x) - \\bar{v}(x),

.. math::
  C_z(x,x') = C_u(x,x') + C_v(x,x'),
  
and 

.. math::
  \mathbf{p}_z(x) = \mathbf{p}_u(x) \cup \mathbf{p}_v(x).


Scaling
-------
A Gaussian process can be scaled by a constant as 

.. math::
  cu(x) = z(x) 

where 

.. math::
  \\bar{z}(x) = c\\bar{u}(x),

.. math::
  C_z(x,x') = c^2C_u(x,x'),

and 

.. math::
  \mathbf{p}_z(x) = \mathbf{p}_u(x).


Differentiation
---------------
A Gaussian process can be differentiated along the direction
:math:`x_i` with the differential operator

.. math::
  D_x = \\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}

as

.. math::
  D_xu(x) = z(x), 

where 

.. math::
  \\bar{z}(x) = D_x\\bar{u}(x),
  
.. math::
  C_z(x,x') = D_xD_{x'}C_u(x,x'),
  
and 

.. math::
  \mathbf{p}_z(x) = \\left\{D_x p_i(x) \mid p_i(x) \in 
                            \mathbf{p}_u(x)\\right\}


Conditioning
------------
A Gaussian process can be conditioned with :math:`q` noisy 
observations of :math:`u(x)`, :math:`\mathbf{d}=\{d_i\}_{i=1}^q`, 
which have been made at locations :math:`\mathbf{y}=\{y_i\}_{i=1}^q`. 
These observations have noise with zero mean and covariance described 
by :math:`\mathbf{C_d}`. The conditioned Gaussian process is

.. math::
  u(x) | \mathbf{d} = z(x) 
  
where
  
.. math::
  \\bar{z}(x) = \\bar{u}(x) + 
                \mathbf{k}(x,\mathbf{y})
                \mathbf{K}(\mathbf{y})^{-1}
                \mathbf{r}^*,

.. math::
  C_{z}(x,x') = C_u(x,x') - 
                \mathbf{k}(x,\mathbf{y}) 
                \mathbf{K}(\mathbf{y})^{-1}
                \mathbf{k}(x',\mathbf{y})^T,                

and

.. math::
  \mathbf{p}_z(x) = \emptyset.

In the above equations we use the augmented covariance matrices, 
:math:`\mathbf{k}` and :math:`\mathbf{K}`, whose entries are

.. math::
  \mathbf{k}(x,\mathbf{y}) = 
  \\left[
  \\begin{array}{cc}
    \\left[C_u(x,y_i)\\right]_{y_i \in \mathbf{y}} 
    & \mathbf{p}_u(x) \\\\
  \\end{array}  
  \\right]

and      
           
.. math::
  \mathbf{K}(\mathbf{y}) = 
  \\left[
  \\begin{array}{cc}
    \mathbf{C_d} + \\left[C_u(y_i,y_j)\\right]_
    {y_i,y_j \in \mathbf{y}\\times\mathbf{y}} 
    & [\mathbf{p}_u(y_i)]_{y_i \in \mathbf{y}} \\\\
    [\mathbf{p}_u(y_i)]^T_{y_i \in \mathbf{y}}   
    & \mathbf{0}    \\\\
  \\end{array}  
  \\right].

We define the residual vector as

.. math::
  \mathbf{r} = \\left([d_i - \\bar{u}(y_i)]_{i=1}^q\\right)^T
  
and :math:`\mathbf{r}^*` is the residual vector which has been
suitably padded with zeros. Note that there are no improper basis 
functions in :math:`z` because it is assumed that there is enough data
in :math:`\mathbf{d}` to constrain the basis functions in :math:`u`.
If :math:`\mathbf{d}` is not sufficiently informative then
:math:`\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{y})` will not be invertible. A necessary but 
not sufficient condition for :math:`\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{y})` to be 
invertible is that :math:`q \geq m`.


Special Classes of Gaussian Processes
=====================================

Isotropic Gaussian Processes
----------------------------
An isotropic Gaussian process has a constant mean and a covariance 
function that can be written as a function of :math:`||x - x'||_2`. We 
describe the mean and covariance for an isotropic Gaussian processes, 
:math:`u(x)`, as

.. math::
  \\bar{u}(x) = a,
  
and

.. math::
  C_u(x,x') = b\phi\\left(||x - x'||_2\ ; c\\right), 

Where :math:`\phi(r\ ; \epsilon)` is a positive definite radial basis 
function with shape parameter :math:`\epsilon`, and :math:`a`,
:math:`b`, and :math:`c` are distribution parameters. One common 
choice for :math:`\phi` is the squared exponential function,

.. math::
  \phi(r\ ;\epsilon) = \exp\\left(\\frac{-r^2}{\epsilon^2}\\right),

which has the useful property of being infinitely differentiable. An 
instance of an isotropic `GaussianProcess` can be created with the 
function `gpiso`.


Basis Function-Constrained Gaussian Processes
---------------------------------------------
A basis function-constrained Gaussian process, :math:`u(x)`, has
realizations that are limited to the space spanned by a set of
basis functions, :math:`\mathbf{f}(x) = \{f_i(x)\}_{i=1}^m`. That is
to say

.. math::
  u(x) = \sum_{i=1}^m a_i f_i(x),

where :math:`\mathbf{a} = \{a_i\}_{i=1}^m` and 

.. math::
  \mathbf{a} \\sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\\bar{a}},\mathbf{C_a}). 
  
If the variance of :math:`\mathbf{a}` is infinite, then :math:`u(x)` 
can be viewed as a Gaussian process with zero mean, zero covariance, 
and :math:`\mathbf{f}(x)` are the improper basis functions. If
:math:`\mathbf{a}` has a finite variance, then the mean and covariance 
for :math:`u(x)` are described as

.. math::
  \\bar{u}(x) = \mathbf{f}(x)\mathbf{\\bar{a}}^T,
  
and

.. math::
  C_u(x,x') = \mathbf{f}(x)\mathbf{C_a}\mathbf{f}(x')^T.

The basis functions are commonly chosen to be the set of monomials 
that span the space of all polynomials with some degree, :math:`d`. 
For example, if :math:`x \in \mathbb{R}^2` and
:math:`d=1`, then the polynomial basis functions would be

.. math::
  \mathbf{f}(x) = \{1,x,y\}.

An instance of a basis function-constrained `GaussianProcess` can be
created with the functions `gpbfc` and `gpbfci`. If the basis
functions are monomials, then the the `GaussianProcess` can be created
with the function `gppoly`.


Instantiating a `GaussianProcesses`
===================================
This module provides multiple ways to instantiate a `GaussianProcess` 
instance. The most general way, but also the most error-prone, is to 
instantiate a `GaussianProcess` directly with its `__init__` method. 
This requires the user to supply a valid mean and covariance function.  
For example, the below code block demonstrates how to create a 
`GaussianProcess` representing Brownian motion.

>>> import numpy as np
>>> from rbf.gauss import GaussianProcess
>>> def mean(x): return np.zeros(x.shape[0]) 
>>> def cov(x1, x2): return np.min(np.meshgrid(x1[:, 0], x2[:, 0], indexing='ij'), axis=0)
>>> gp = GaussianProcess(mean, cov, dim=1) # Brownian motion is 1D

This module contains a helper function for generating isotropic
`GaussianProcess` instances, which is named `gpiso`. It requires the
user to specify a positive-definite `RBF` instance and the three
distribution parameters mentioned above. For example, the below code
generates a squared exponential Gaussian process with a=0.0, b=1.0,
and c=2.0.

>>> from rbf.basis import se
>>> from rbf.gauss import gpiso
>>> gp = gpiso(se, (0.0, 1.0, 2.0))

Since the squared exponential is so commonly used, this module 
contains the function `gpse` for generating a squared exponential 
`GaussianProcess` instances. The below code block produces a 
`GaussianProcess` that is equivalent to the one generated above.

>>> from rbf.gauss import gpse
>>> gp = gpse((0.0, 1.0, 2.0))

The function `gpbfci` is used for generating `GaussianProcess`
instances with improper basis functions. It requires the user to
specify a function which returns a set of basis functions evaluted at
`x`. For example,

>>> from rbf.gauss import gpbfc, gpbfci
>>> def basis(x): return np.array([np.sin(x[:, 0]), np.cos(x[:, 0])]).T
>>> gp = gpbfci(basis)

Use `gpbfc` to make a basis function-constrained `GaussianProcess`
which has coefficients with finite variance.

>>> mean = [0.0, 0.0] # mean basis function coefficients
>>> sigma = [1.0, 1.0] # uncertainty of basis function coefficients
>>> gp = gpbfc(basis, mean, sigma)

The function `gppoly` is a helper function for creating a Gaussian
process which has monomials for the improper basis functions. The
monomials span the space of all polynomials with some order. This just
requires the user to specify the polynomial order.

>>> from rbf.gauss import gppoly
>>> gp = gppoly(1)

Lastly, a `GaussianProcess` can be created by adding, subtracting, 
scaling, differentiating, or conditioning existing `GaussianProcess` 
instances. For example,

>>> gp  = gpse((0.0, 1.0, 2.0))
>>> gp += gppoly(2) # add second order polynomial basis 
>>> gp *= 2.0 # scale by 2
>>> gp  = gp.differentiate((2,)) # compute second derivative

def likelihood(d, mu, sigma, p=None):
  ''' 
  Returns the log likelihood. If `p` is not specified, then the
  likelihood is the probability of observing `d` from a normally
  distributed random vector with mean `mu` and covariance `sigma`. If
  `d` is expected to contain some unknown linear combination of basis
  vectors (e.g. a constant offset or linear trend), then `p` should be
  specified with those basis vectors as its columns. When `p` is
  specified, the restricted likelihood is returned. The restricted
  likelihood is the probability of observing `R.dot(d)` from a
  normally distributed random vector with mean `R.dot(mu)` and
  covariance `R.dot(sigma).dot(R.T)`, where `R` is a matrix with rows
  that are orthogonal to the columns of `p`. In other words, if `p` is
  specified then the component of `d` which lies along the columns of
  `p` will be ignored.
  
  The restricted likelihood was first described by [1] and it is
  covered in more general reference books such as [2]. Both [1] and
  [2] are good sources for additional information.
  
  Parameters
  ----------
  d : (N,) array
    observations
  
  mu : (N,) array
    mean of the random vector
  
  sigma : (N,) array, (N, N) array, or (N, N) scipy sparse matrix    
    If this is an (N,) array then it describes one standard deviation
    of the random vector. If this is an (N, N) array then it describes
    the covariances.
  
  p : (N, P) array, optional 
    Improper basis vectors. If specified, then `d` is assumed to
    contain some unknown linear combination of the columns of `p`.

  Notes
  -----
  Unlike other functions in this module, if the covariance matrix is
  not numerically positive definite then this function will fail with
  an error rather than trying to coerce it into a positive definite
  matrix.

def outliers(d, s, mu=None, sigma=None, p=None, tol=4.0, maxitr=50):
  ''' 
  Uses a data editing algorithm to identify outliers in `d`. Outliers
  are considered to be the data that are abnormally inconsistent with
  the Gaussian process described by `mu` (mean), `sigma` (covariance),
  and `p` (basis vectors). This function can only be used for data
  with nonzero, uncorrelated noise.

  The data editing algorithm first conditions the Gaussian process
  with the observations, then it compares each residual (`d` minus the
  expected value of the posterior divided by `sigma`) to the RMS of
  residuals. Data with residuals greater than `tol` times the RMS are
  identified as outliers. This process is then repeated using the
  subset of `d` which were not flagged as outliers. If no new outliers
  are detected in an iteration then the algorithm stops.

  Parameters
  ----------  
  d : (N,) float array
    Observations
  
  s : (N,) float array
    One standard deviation uncertainty on the observations. 
  
  mu : (N,) float array, optional
    Mean of the Gaussian process at the observation points. Defaults
    to zeros.

  sigma : (N,) array, (N, N) array, or (N, N) scipy sparse matrix, optional
    Covariance of the Gaussian process at the observation points.
    Defaults to zeros.
  
  p : (N, P) float array, optional
    Improper basis vectors for the Gaussian process evaluated at the
    observation points. Defaults to an (N, 0) array.
  
  tol : float, optional
    Outlier tolerance. Smaller values make the algorithm more likely
    to identify outliers. A good value is 4.0 and this should not be
    set any lower than 2.0.
  
  maxitr : int, optional
    Maximum number of iterations.

class GaussianProcess(object):
  ''' 
  A `GaussianProcess` instance represents a stochastic process which
  is defined in terms of a mean function, a covariance function, and
  (optionally) a set of improper basis functions. This class is used
  to perform basic operations on Gaussian processes which include
  addition, subtraction, scaling, differentiation, sampling, and
  conditioning.
    
  Parameters
  ----------
  mean : function 
    Function which returns either the mean of the Gaussian process at
    `x` or a specified derivative of the mean at `x`. This has the
    call signature
    
    `out = mean(x)`

    or 
    
    `out = mean(x, diff)`
    
    `x` is an (N, D) array of positions. `diff` is a (D,) int array
    derivative specification (e.g. [0, 1] indicates to return the
    derivative along the second basis direction). `out` must be an
    (N,) array. If this function only takes one argument then it is
    assumed to not be differentiable and the `differentiate` method
    for the `GaussianProcess` instance will return an error.

  covariance : function
    Function which returns either the covariance of the Gaussian
    process between points `x1` and `x2` or the covariance of the
    specified derivatives of the Gaussian process between points `x1`
    and `x2`. This has the call signature
    
    `out = covariance(x1, x2)`

    or 
    
    `out = covariance(x1, x2, diff1, diff2)`

    `x1` and `x2` are (N, D) and (M, D) arrays of positions,
    respectively. `diff1` and `diff2` are (D,) int array derivative
    specifications. `out` can be an (N, M) array or scipy sparse matrix
    (csc format would be most efficient). If this function only takes
    two arguments, then it is assumed to not be differentiable and the
    `differentiate` method for the `GaussianProcess` instance will
    return an error.

  basis : function, optional
    Function which returns either the improper basis functions
    evaluated at `x` or the specified derivative of the improper basis
    functions evaluated at `x`. This has the call signature

    `out = basis(x)`

    or 
    
    `out = basis(x, diff)`

    `x` is an (N, D) array of positions. `diff` is a (D,) int array
    derivative specification. `out` is an (N, P) array where each
    column corresponds to a basis function. By default, a
    `GaussianProcess` instance contains no improper basis functions.
    If this function only takes one argument, then it is assumed to
    not be differentiable and the `differentiate` method for the
    `GaussianProcess` instance will return an error.
        
  dim : int, optional  
    Fixes the spatial dimensions of the `GaussianProcess` instance. An
    error will be raised if method arguments have a conflicting number
    of spatial dimensions. 
    
  Notes
  -----
  1. This class does not check whether the specified covariance
  function is positive definite, making it easy to construct an
  invalid `GaussianProcess` instance. For this reason, one may prefer
  to create a `GaussianProcess` with one of the constructor functions
  (e.g., `gpse` or `gppoly`).
  
  2. A `GaussianProcess` returned by `add`, `subtract`, `scale`, 
  `differentiate`, and `condition` has `mean`, `covariance`, and 
  `basis` function which calls the `mean`, `covariance`, and `basis` 
  functions of its parents. Due to this recursive implementation, the 
  number of generations of children (for lack of a better term) is 
  limited by the maximum recursion depth.

    ''' 
    Uses a data editing algorithm to identify outliers in `d`.
    Outliers are considered to be the data that are abnormally
    inconsistent with the `GaussianProcess`. This method can only be
    used for data that has nonzero, uncorrelated noise.

    The data editing algorithm first conditions the `GaussianProcess`
    with the observations, then it compares each residual (`d` minus
    the expected value of the posterior divided by `sigma`) to the RMS
    of residuals. Data with residuals greater than `tol` times the RMS
    are identified as outliers. This process is then repeated using
    the subset of `d` which were not flagged as outliers. If no new
    outliers are detected in an iteration then the algorithms stops.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    y : (N, D) float array
      Observation points.
    
    d : (N,) float array

    tol : float

      set any lower than 2.0.
