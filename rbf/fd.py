            eps=1.0):
  ''' 
  Returns the weights which map a functions values at `s` to an 
  approximation of that functions derivative at `x`. The weights are 
  computed using the RBF-FD method described in [1]. In this function 
  `x` is a single point in D-dimensional space. Use `weight_matrix` to 
  compute the weights for multiple point.

  Parameters
  ----------
  x : (D,) array
    Target point. The weights will approximate the derivative at this
    point.

  s : (N, D) array
    Stencil points. The derivative will be approximated with a
    weighted sum of the function values at this point.

  diffs : (D,) int array or (K, D) int array 
    Derivative orders for each spatial dimension. For example `[2, 0]`
    indicates that the weights should approximate the second
    derivative with respect to the first spatial dimension in
    two-dimensional space.  diffs can also be a (K, D) array, where
    each (D,) sub-array is a term in a differential operator. For
    example the two-dimensional Laplacian can be represented as
    `[[2, 0], [0, 2]]`.

  coeffs : (K,) array, optional 
    Coefficients for each term in the differential operator specified
    with `diffs`.  Defaults to an array of ones. If `diffs` was
    specified as a (D,) array then `coeffs` should be a length 1
    array.

  basis : rbf.basis.RBF, optional
    Type of RBF. Select from those available in `rbf.basis` or create
    your own.
 
  order : int, optional
    Order of the added polynomial. This defaults to the highest
    derivative order. For example, if `diffs` is `[[2, 0], [0, 1]]`, then
    order is set to 2.

  eps : float or (N,) array, optional
    Shape parameter for each RBF, which have centers `s`. This only 
    makes a difference when using RBFs that are not scale invariant. 
    All the predefined RBFs except for the odd order polyharmonic 
    splines are not scale invariant.

  Returns
  -------
  out : (N,) array
    RBF-FD weights
    
  Examples
  --------
  Calculate the weights for a one-dimensional second order derivative.

  >>> x = np.array([1.0]) 
  >>> s = np.array([[0.0], [1.0], [2.0]]) 
  >>> diff = (2,) 
  >>> weights(x, s, diff)
  array([ 1., -2., 1.])
    
  Calculate the weights for estimating an x derivative from three 
  points in a two-dimensional plane

  >>> x = np.array([0.25, 0.25])
  >>> s = np.array([[0.0, 0.0],
                    [1.0, 0.0],
                    [0.0, 1.0]])
  >>> diff = (1, 0)
  >>> weights(x, s, diff)
  array([ -1., 1., 0.])
    
  Notes
  -----
  This function may become unstable with high order polynomials (i.e.,
  `order` is high). This can be somewhat remedied by shifting the
  coordinate system so that x is zero

  Returns a weight matrix which maps a functions values at `p` to an

  convenience function which first creates a stencil network and then

  Parameters
  ----------
  x : (N, D) array

  p : (M, D) array

    specified as a (D,) array then `coeffs` should be a length 1
    array. If the coefficients for the differential operator vary with
    `x` then `coeffs` can be specified as a (K, N) array.

  basis : rbf.basis.RBF, optional

    your own.

  order : int, optional
    Order of the added polynomial. This defaults to the highest

    `order` is set to 2.

  eps : float or (M,) array, optional

    makes a difference when using RBFs that are not scale invariant.  
    All the predefined RBFs except for the odd order polyharmonic 
    splines are not scale invariant.

  n : int, optional
    Stencil size.
    
  stencils : (N, n) int array, optional
    The stencils for each node in `x`. This consists of indices of
    nodes in `p` that make up each stencil. If this is given then the
    value for `n` will be ignored. If this is not given then the
    stencils will be created based on nearest neighbors.
