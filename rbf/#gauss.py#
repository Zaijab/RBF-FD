''' 
This module defines a class, *GaussianProcess*, which is an 
abstraction that allows one to easily work with Gaussian processes. 
One main use for the *GaussianProcess* class is Gaussian process 
regression (GPR). GPR is also known as Kriging or Least Squares 
Collocation.  It is a technique for constructing a continuous function 
from discrete observations by incorporating a stochastic prior model 
for the underlying function.  GPR is performed with the *condition* 
method of a *GaussianProcess* instance. In addition to GPR, the 
*GaussianProcess* class can be used for basic arithmetic with Gaussian 
processes and for generating random samples of a Gaussian process.

There are several existing python packages for Gaussian processes (See
www.gaussianprocess.org for an updated list of packages). This module
was written because existing software lacked the ability to 1) create
partially improper Gaussian processes 2) compute analytical
derivatives of a Gaussian process and 3) condition a Gaussian process
with derivative constraints. Other software packages have a strong
focus on optimizing hyperparameters based on data likelihood. This
module does not include any optimization routines and hyperparameters
are always explicitly specified by the user. However, the
*GaussianProcess* class contains the *likelihood* method which can be
used with functions from *scipy.optimize* to construct a
hyperparameter optimization routine.


Gaussian Processes
==================
A proper Gaussian process, :math:`u_o(x)`, is a stochastic function
that is normally distributed in the space of all functions. A Gaussian
process can be defined in terms of its mean, :math:`\\bar{u}(x)`, and
its covariance, :math:`C_u(x,x')`, as

.. math::
  u_o \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\bar{u},C_u\\right).

In this module, we adopt a more general definition which allows for
partially improper Gaussian processes (i.e. a Gaussian process which
has infinite variance along some directions).  We then consider a
Gaussian process, :math:`u(x)`, to be the combination of a proper
Gaussian process and a set of basis functions, :math:`\mathbf{p}_u(x)
= \{p_i(x)\}_{i=1}^m`, whose coefficients, :math:`\{c_i\}_{i=1}^m`,
have infinite variance. We express :math:`u(x)` as

.. math::
  u(x) = u_o(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m c_i p_i(x).

Throughout this module, we refer to :math:`\mathbf{p}_u(x)` as the
improper basis functions. We consider five operations on Gaussian
processes: addition, subtraction, scaling, differentiation, and
conditioning. Each operation produces another Gaussian process which
possesses the same five operations. These operations are described
below.


Operations on Gaussian Processes
================================

Addition
--------
Two uncorrelated Gaussian processes, :math:`u` and :math:`v`, can be 
added as

.. math::
  u(x) + v(x) = z(x)

where the mean, covariance, and improper basis functions for 
:math:`z` are

.. math::
  \\bar{z}(x) = \\bar{u}(x) + \\bar{v}(x),

.. math::
  C_z(x,x') = C_u(x,x') + C_v(x,x'),
  
and 

.. math::
  \mathbf{p}_z(x) = \mathbf{p}_u(x) \cup \mathbf{p}_v(x).

Subtraction
-----------
A Gaussian process can be subtracted from another Gaussian processes 
as

.. math::
  u(x) - v(x) = z(x) 

where 

.. math::
  \\bar{z}(x) = \\bar{u}(x) - \\bar{v}(x),

.. math::
  C_z(x,x') = C_u(x,x') + C_v(x,x'),
  
and 

.. math::
  \mathbf{p}_z(x) = \mathbf{p}_u(x) \cup \mathbf{p}_v(x).


Scaling
-------
A Gaussian process can be scaled by a constant as 

.. math::
  cu(x) = z(x) 

where 

.. math::
  \\bar{z}(x) = c\\bar{u}(x),

.. math::
  C_z(x,x') = c^2C_u(x,x'),

and 

.. math::
  \mathbf{p}_z(x) = \mathbf{p}_u(x).


Differentiation
---------------
A Gaussian process can be differentiated along the direction
:math:`x_i` with the differential operator

.. math::
  D_x = \\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}

as

.. math::
  D_xu(x) = z(x), 

where 

.. math::
  \\bar{z}(x) = D_x\\bar{u}(x),
  
.. math::
  C_z(x,x') = D_xD_{x'}C_u(x,x'),
  
and 

.. math::
  \mathbf{p}_z(x) = \\left\{D_x p_i(x) \mid p_i(x) \in 
                            \mathbf{p}_u(x)\\right\}


Conditioning
------------
A Gaussian process can be conditioned with :math:`q` noisy 
observations of :math:`u(x)`, :math:`\mathbf{d}=\{d_i\}_{i=1}^q`, 
which have been made at locations :math:`\mathbf{y}=\{y_i\}_{i=1}^q`. 
These observations have noise with zero mean and covariance described 
by :math:`\mathbf{C_d}`. The conditioned Gaussian process is

.. math::
  u(x) | \mathbf{d} = z(x) 
  
where
  
.. math::
  \\bar{z}(x) = \\bar{u}(x) + 
                \mathbf{k}(x,\mathbf{y})
                \mathbf{K}(\mathbf{y})^{-1}
                \mathbf{r}^*,

.. math::
  C_{z}(x,x') = C_u(x,x') - 
                \mathbf{k}(x,\mathbf{y}) 
                \mathbf{K}(\mathbf{y})^{-1}
                \mathbf{k}(x',\mathbf{y})^T,                

and

.. math::
  \mathbf{p}_z(x) = \emptyset.

In the above equations we use the augmented covariance matrices, 
:math:`\mathbf{k}` and :math:`\mathbf{K}`, whose entries are

.. math::
  \mathbf{k}(x,\mathbf{y}) = 
  \\left[
  \\begin{array}{cc}
    \\left[C_u(x,y_i)\\right]_{y_i \in \mathbf{y}} 
    & \mathbf{p}_u(x) \\\\
  \\end{array}  
  \\right]

and      
           
.. math::
  \mathbf{K}(\mathbf{y}) = 
  \\left[
  \\begin{array}{cc}
    \mathbf{C_d} + \\left[C_u(y_i,y_j)\\right]_
    {y_i,y_j \in \mathbf{y}\\times\mathbf{y}} 
    & [\mathbf{p}_u(y_i)]_{y_i \in \mathbf{y}} \\\\
    [\mathbf{p}_u(y_i)]^T_{y_i \in \mathbf{y}}   
    & \mathbf{0}    \\\\
  \\end{array}  
  \\right].

We define the residual vector as

.. math::
  \mathbf{r} = \\left([d_i - \\bar{u}(y_i)]_{i=1}^q\\right)^T
  
and :math:`\mathbf{r}^*` is the residual vector which has been
suitably padded with zeros. Note that there are no improper basis 
functions in :math:`z` because it is assumed that there is enough data
in :math:`\mathbf{d}` to constrain the basis functions in :math:`u`.
If :math:`\mathbf{d}` is not sufficiently informative then
:math:`\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{y})` will not be invertible. A necessary but 
not sufficient condition for :math:`\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{y})` to be 
invertible is that :math:`q \geq m`.


Special Classes of Gaussian Processes
=====================================

Isotropic Gaussian Processes
----------------------------
An isotropic Gaussian process has a constant mean and a covariance 
function that can be written as a function of :math:`||x - x'||_2`. We 
describe the mean and covariance for an isotropic Gaussian processes, 
:math:`u(x)`, as

.. math::
  \\bar{u}(x) = a,
  
and

.. math::
  C_u(x,x') = b\phi\\left(||x - x'||_2\ ; c\\right), 

Where :math:`\phi(r\ ; \epsilon)` is a positive definite radial basis 
function with shape parameter :math:`\epsilon`, and :math:`a`,
:math:`b`, and :math:`c` are distribution parameters. One common 
choice for :math:`\phi` is the squared exponential function,

.. math::
  \phi(r\ ;\epsilon) = \exp\\left(\\frac{-r^2}{\epsilon^2}\\right),

which has the useful property of being infinitely differentiable. An 
instance of an isotropic *GaussianProcess* can be created with the 
function *gpiso*.


Basis Function-Constrained Gaussian Processes
---------------------------------------------
A basis function-constrained Gaussian process, :math:`u(x)`, has
realizations that are limited to the space spanned by a set of
basis functions, :math:`\mathbf{f}(x) = \{f_i(x)\}_{i=1}^m`. That is
to say

.. math::
  u(x) = \sum_{i=1}^m a_i f_i(x),

where :math:`\mathbf{a} = \{a_i\}_{i=1}^m` and 

.. math::
  \mathbf{a} \\sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\\bar{a}},\mathbf{C_a}). 
  
If the variance of :math:`\mathbf{a}` is infinite, then :math:`u(x)` 
can be viewed as a Gaussian process with zero mean, zero covariance, 
and :math:`\mathbf{f}(x)` are the improper basis functions. If
:math:`\mathbf{a}` has a finite variance, then the mean and covariance 
for :math:`u(x)` are described as

.. math::
  \\bar{u}(x) = \mathbf{f}(x)\mathbf{\\bar{a}}^T,
  
and

.. math::
  C_u(x,x') = \mathbf{f}(x)\mathbf{C_a}\mathbf{f}(x')^T.

The basis functions are commonly chosen to be the set of monomials 
that span the space of all polynomials with some degree, :math:`d`. 
For example, if :math:`x \in \mathbb{R}^2` and
:math:`d=1`, then the polynomial basis functions would be

.. math::
  \mathbf{f}(x) = \{1,x,y\}.

An instance of a basis function-constrained *GaussianProcess* can be
created with the functions *gpbfc* and *gpbfci*. If the basis
functions are monomials, then the the *GaussianProcess* can be created
with the function *gppoly*.


Instantiating a *GaussianProcesses*
===================================
This module provides multiple ways to instantiate a *GaussianProcess* 
instance. The most general way, but also the most error-prone, is to 
instantiate a *GaussianProcess* directly with its *__init__* method. 
This requires the user to supply a valid mean and covariance function.  
For example, the below code block demonstrates how to create a 
*GaussianProcess* representing Brownian motion.

>>> import numpy as np
>>> from rbf.gauss import GaussianProcess
>>> def mean(x): return np.zeros(x.shape[0]) 
>>> def cov(x1,x2): return np.min(np.meshgrid(x1[:,0],x2[:,0],indexing='ij'),axis=0)
>>> gp = GaussianProcess(mean,cov,dim=1) # Brownian motion is 1D

This module contains a helper function for generating isotropic
*GaussianProcess* instances, which is named *gpiso*. It requires the
user to specify a positive-definite *RBF* instance and the three
distribution parameters mentioned above. For example, the below code
generates a squared exponential Gaussian process with a=0.0, b=1.0,
and c=2.0.

>>> from rbf.basis import se
>>> from rbf.gauss import gpiso
>>> gp = gpiso(se,(0.0,1.0,2.0))

Since the squared exponential is so commonly used, this module 
contains the function *gpse* for generating a squared exponential 
*GaussianProcess* instances. The below code block produces a 
*GaussianProcess* that is equivalent to the one generated above.

>>> from rbf.gauss import gpse
>>> gp = gpse((0.0,1.0,2.0))

The function *gpbfci* is used for generating *GaussianProcess*
instances with improper basis functions. It requires the user to
specify a function which returns a set of basis functions evaluted at
*x*. For example,

>>> from rbf.gauss import gpbfc,gpbfci
>>> def basis(x): return np.array([np.sin(x[:,0]),np.cos(x[:,0])]).T
>>> gp = gpbfci(basis)

Use *gpbfc* to make a basis function-constrained *GaussianProcess*
which has coefficients with finite variance.

>>> mean = [0.0,0.0] # mean basis function coefficients
>>> sigma = [1.0,1.0] # uncertainty of basis function coefficients
>>> gp = gpbfc(basis,mean,sigma)

The function *gppoly* is a helper function for creating a Gaussian
process which has monomials for the improper basis functions. The
monomials span the space of all polynomials with some order. This just
requires the user to specify the polynomial order.

>>> from rbf.gauss import gppoly
>>> gp = gppoly(1)

Lastly, a *GaussianProcess* can be created by adding, subtracting, 
scaling, differentiating, or conditioning existing *GaussianProcess* 
instances. For example,

>>> gp  = gpse((0.0,1.0,2.0))
>>> gp += gppoly(2) # add second order polynomial basis 
>>> gp *= 2.0 # scale by 2
>>> gp  = gp.differentiate((2,)) # compute second derivative

def likelihood(d,mu,sigma,p=None):
  ''' 
  Returns the log likelihood. If *p* is not specified, then the
  likelihood is the probability of observing *d* from a normally
  distributed random vector with mean *mu* and covariance *sigma*. If
  *d* is expected to contain some unknown linear combination of basis
  vectors (e.g. a constant offset or linear trend), then *p* should be
  specified with those basis vectors as its columns. When *p* is
  specified, the restricted likelihood is returned. The restricted
  likelihood is the probability of observing *R.dot(d)* from a
  normally distributed random vector with mean *R.dot(mu)* and
  covariance *R.dot(sigma).dot(R.T)*, where *R* is a matrix with rows
  that are orthogonal to the columns of *p*. In other words, if *p* is
  specified then the component of *d* which lies along the columns of
  *p* will be ignored.
  
  The restricted likelihood was first described by [1] and it is
  covered in more general reference books such as [2]. Both [1] and
  [2] are good sources for additional information.
  
  Parameters
  ----------
  d : (N,) array
    observations
  
  mu : (N,) array
    mean of the random vector
  
  sigma : (N,) or (N,N) array    
    If this is an (N,) array then it describes one standard deviation
    of the random vector. If this is an (N,N) array then it describes
    the covariances.
  
  p : (N,P) array, optional  
    Improper basis vectors. If specified, then *d* is assumed to
    contain some unknown linear combination of the columns of *p*.

class GaussianProcess(object):
  ''' 
  A *GaussianProcess* instance represents a stochastic process which
  is defined in terms of a mean function, a covariance function, and
  (optionally) a set of improper basis functions. This class is used
  to perform basic operations on Gaussian processes which include
  addition, subtraction, scaling, differentiation, sampling, and
  conditioning.
    
  Parameters
  ----------
  mean : function 
    Mean function for the Gaussian process. This takes either one 
    argument, *x*, or two arguments, *x* and *diff*. *x* is an (N,D) 
    array of positions and *diff* is a (D,) array specifying the 
    derivative. If the function only takes one argument, then the 
    function is assumed to not be differentiable. The function should 
    return an (N,) array.

  covariance : function
    Covariance function for the Gaussian process. This takes either
    two arguments, *x1* and *x2*, or four arguments, *x1*, *x2*,
    *diff1* and *diff2*. *x1* and *x2* are (N,D) and (M,D) arrays of
    positions, respectively. *diff1* and *diff2* are (D,) arrays
    specifying the derivatives with respect to *x1* and *x2*,
    respectively. If the function only takes two arguments, then the
    function is assumed to not be differentiable. The function should
    return an (N,M) array.

  basis : function, optional
    Improper basis functions. This function takes either one argument,
    *x*, or two arguments, *x* and *diff*. *x* is an (N,D) array of
    positions and *diff* is a (D,) array specifying the derivative.
    This function should return an (N,P) array, where each column is a
    basis function evaluated at *x*. By default, a *GaussianProcess*
    instance contains no improper basis functions.
        
  dim : int, optional  
    Fixes the spatial dimensions of the *GaussianProcess* domain. An 
    error will be raised if method arguments have a conflicting number 
    of spatial dimensions.
    
  Notes
  -----
  1. This class does not check whether the specified covariance 
  function is positive definite, making it easy construct an invalid 
  *GaussianProcess* instance. For this reason, one may prefer to 
  create a *GaussianProcess* with the functions *gpiso*, *gpbasis*, or 
  *gppoly*.
  
  2. A *GaussianProcess* returned by *add*, *subtract*, *scale*, 
  *differentiate*, and *condition* has *mean*, *covariance*, and 
  *basis* function which calls the *mean*, *covariance*, and *basis* 
  functions of its parents. Due to this recursive implementation, the 
  number of generations of children (for lack of a better term) is 
  limited by the maximum recursion depth.

  ''' 
  Creates an isotropic *GaussianProcess* instance which has a constant

  Parameters
  ----------
  phi : RBF instance
    Radial basis function describing the covariance function. For 
    example, use *rbf.basis.se* for a squared exponential covariance 
    function.

  params : 3-tuple  
    Tuple of three parameters, *a*, *b*, and *c*, describing the
    probability distribution. *a* is the mean, *b* scales the
    covariance function, and *c* is the shape parameter. When *phi* is
    set to *rbf.basis.se*, *b* and *c* describe the variance and the
    characteristic length-scale, respectively.

    error will be raised if method arguments have a conflicting number

  Returns
  -------

  Notes
  -----
  1. If *phi* is scale invariant, such as for odd order polyharmonic 
  splines, then *b* and *c* have inverse effects on the resulting 
  *GaussianProcess* and thus only one of them needs to be chosen while 
  the other can be fixed at an arbitary value.
  
  2. Not all radial basis functions are positive definite, which means 
  that it is possible to instantiate an invalid *GaussianProcess*. The 
  method *is_positive_definite* provides a necessary but not 
  sufficient test for positive definiteness. Examples of predefined 
  *RBF* instances which are positive definite include: *rbf.basis.se*, 
  *rbf.basis.ga*, *rbf.basis.exp*, *rbf.basis.iq*, *rbf.basis.imq*.
